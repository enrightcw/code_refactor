# Code Refactor

Refactoring activity using semantic elements to more specifically identify the aspects of the html in question.  Also, added alt tags to all images to make the page accessible to screen readers.  Finally, cleaned up indenting and added comments to better describe the various elements.  Vetted and tested the CSS after changes to make sure the site continued to work as intended.
